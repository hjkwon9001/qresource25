## Quantum resources 2025
<h3 class="lessspace"><em>Jeju, 17 &ndash; 21 March 2025</em></h3>

Various properties of quantum systems are starting to find use in the development of practical quantum technologies, elevating phenomena such as entanglement and coherence from mathematical curiosities to physical resources. The framework of quantum resource theories aims to understand these features in a unified fashion and establish methods to characterise them effectively.

The workshop *Quantum resources: from mathematical foundations to operational characterisation* is concerned with the theoretical investigation of quantum resources, and in particular on bridging the gap between the abstract mathematical description of resource theories and the protocols for their practical exploitation.

The workshop will consist of invited talks by experts in various aspects of quantum resource theories as well as contributed talks, poster sessions, and extended discussion sessions.

This is a successor of the previous events, Quantum resources: from mathematical foundations to operational characterisation, which took place in December 2022.
