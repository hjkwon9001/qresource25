Due to the rapidly escalating novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the international travel restrictions imposed by Singapore and many other countries, the workshop "Quantum resources: from mathematical foundations to operational characterisation" has been postponed until late November 2020. An updated workshop notice containing the new dates and deadlines is attached below.

We will continue to monitor the global situation closely and will take appropriate measures, including a possible further postponement, should the travel restrictions remain in place.

=======

The workshop "Quantum resources: from mathematical foundations to operational characterisation" will take place at hotel Swiss√¥tel Merchant Court, Singapore, from 30th November to 3rd December 2020.

The workshop is concerned with the theoretical investigation of quantum resources, and in particular on bridging the gap between the abstract mathematical description of resource theories and the protocols for their practical exploitation.

It will consist of invited talks by experts in various aspects of quantum resource theories as well as contributed talks, poster sessions, and extended discussion sessions.
